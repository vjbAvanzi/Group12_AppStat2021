# Group12_AppStat2021
programmes for data analysis developed during the Master course "Applied Statistics-2021/2022" of the Copenhagen University.
The codes and the report are written after a lab experience, which took place on the 3rd of December 2021 and the entire writing process has been made in 12 days.
This Project was a Group project and we are Group12.

Ad maiora!
